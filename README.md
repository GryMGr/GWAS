# Intro
Because more and more researchers at NIPH are working with GWAS and other (-omics) data, we should collect a framework and a potential R package like structure for fast and reliable functionality and analysis for this kind of data. 

This repo is an effort to promote collaboration for analysis in GWAS, and for documentation. We can also use this as a platform to discuss problems or trobleshoot (using the ticket system in _issues_).  

## Stucture
This repos will with time contain a R-package like structure with _easy to use_ functions for running GWAS or similar -omics rutiune, including basic QC for GWAS and meta-analysis for combinding GWAS results from different cohorts. 

**I also think that we could use the Wiki section to add some info on GWAS in general and the GWAS that are availabe for FHI researhers** _Any toughs about that?_ 
Something similar to the [MoBa Wiki](https://mobawiki.fhi.no/mobawiki/index.php/Questionnaires).
